# Project Title

The Knob Hills Trail Race is a Ultra/Marathon trail race in North DFW, and I was asked to build it out beyond the one-page Squarespace page that is currently being used. It is one of two trail races that are currently run by the Denton Area Running Club (DARC). 

The site will eventually include:
1) Landing Page
2) Race Information page
3) Volunteer page
4) History page
5) Shop page
6) Galleries page
7) FAQ page

I will post the live link, well, when it's eventually live. This is my first, from scratch website and I'm super excited to share it.
